`segmentation fault`    
A segmentation fault (Segmentation fault python3 "__.py") often signals that the Python process attempted to access memory it shouldn't, which can happen for various reasons, especially when working with large datasets or libraries that interface with lower-level compiled code (like netCDF4 or dask).
