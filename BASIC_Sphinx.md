# Sphinx 
```
an open-source tool used for generating documentation for Python projects. It converts reStructuredText (reST) files into various output formats, such as HTML, LaTeX, ePub, and PDF. Sphinx is particularly popular in the Python community because of its ability to create comprehensive and organized documentation, including code documentation with autodoc extensions.
```
## Key features of Sphinx documentation:  
1. **Automatic Code Documentation**: Sphinx can automatically extract documentation from docstrings in your code using the autodoc extension.  
1. **Cross-referencing**: It supports cross-referencing of documentation with roles and directives, which is especially useful for large projects.  
1. **Theming**: Sphinx allows you to apply different themes to your documentation, making it visually appealing.  
1. **Extensibility**: Sphinx is highly extensible with numerous extensions available for additional functionality, such as support for Jupyter notebooks, diagram generation, and more.  
1. **Multi-format Output**: Sphinx can generate documentation in multiple formats, making it versatile for different publishing needs.   
1. **Indexing and Search**: It provides automatic generation of indexes and search functionality for HTML documentation.  
1. **Intersphinx**: This extension allows you to link to the documentation of other projects, which is useful for libraries that depend on other libraries.  


## To use Sphinx for a Python project
Need to install it via `pip`, set up a configuration file, and write your documentation in reStructuredText.    


## Sphinx for a Python project
```
pip install sphinx
sphinx-quickstart
make html
```  
This process will generate HTML files that you can view in a web browser to see your documentation.  

Writing documentation in reStructuredText (.rst) files involves using a simple and readable markup syntax.

```  
Save the above as `.rst` and then it will be converted to `html`. By following these steps, you can create well-structured and readable documentation for your project using reStructuredText and Sphinx.    

Sphinx excels in creating detailed, structured documentation for software projects, leveraging reStructuredText and rich documentation features.


## Workflow to create documentation that integrates with the code   
1. **Writing Documentation**: Written in reStructuredText (.rst) files.
1. **Sphinx**: Used to generate HTML from the .rst files.
1. **Read the Docs**: Hosts the generated HTML files, automatically updates with each commit.  
This process ensures that the documentation is both comprehensive and automatically updated, providing users with the latest information about the project.
